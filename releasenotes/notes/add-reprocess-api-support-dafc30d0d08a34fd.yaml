    Introduce reprocessing task API in the CLI. The following new commands
    are added to the OpenStack CLI "rating tasks reprocessing get" and
    "rating tasks reprocessing create". For CloudKitty CLI, we added the
    following new commands "tasks reprocessing get" and "tasks reprocessing
    create". Both command sets work in a similar fashion, but one is
    targetting the OpenStack CLI integration, whereas the other is
    targetting CloudKitty client only.
